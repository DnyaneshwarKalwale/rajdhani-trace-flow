```

## Usage Examples

### **Order Creation with No Advance Payment**
```typescript
const order = {
    subtotal: 50000,
    gst_rate: 18,
    gst_amount: 9000,
    total_amount: 59000,
    paid_amount: 0,        // No advance payment
    outstanding_amount: 59000,
    payment_status: 'pending',
    payment_terms: '30 days'
};
```

### **Order Creation with Partial Payment**
```typescript
const order = {
    subtotal: 50000,
    gst_rate: 18,
    gst_amount: 9000,
    total_amount: 59000,
    paid_amount: 20000,    // Partial advance payment
    outstanding_amount: 39000,
    payment_status: 'partial',
    payment_terms: '30 days'
};
```

### **Order Creation with Full Payment**
```typescript
const order = {
    subtotal: 50000,
    gst_rate: 18,
    gst_amount: 9000,
    total_amount: 59000,
    paid_amount: 59000,    // Full payment
    outstanding_amount: 0,
    payment_status: 'paid',
    payment_terms: 'Paid in full'
};
```

## Payment Status Logic

### **Status Determination**
- **Paid**: Outstanding amount ≤ 0
- **Partial**: Paid amount > 0 but outstanding amount > 0
- **Pending**: Paid amount = 0

### **Outstanding Amount Calculation**
```
Outstanding Amount = Total Amount (with GST) - Paid Amount
```

## Customer Outstanding Management

### **Automatic Tracking**
- Each order creates an entry in `customer_outstanding`
- Outstanding amounts are automatically calculated
- Payment status is updated in real-time

### **Customer Summary**
- Total outstanding amount per customer
- Number of pending/partial/paid orders
- Payment due dates
- Payment history

## Implementation Steps
