# Complete Setup Guide - Rajdhani Trace Flow

## üöÄ Quick Start (When Internet is Back)

### 1. Database Setup
Run this SQL script in your Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of simplified-database-fix.sql
```

### 2. Test the Application
1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to Products page
3. Create a new product with individual stock tracking enabled
4. Verify that meaningful IDs are generated (PRO-YYMMDD-XXX, IPD-YYMMDD-XXX)

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

### Database Scripts
- `simplified-database-fix.sql` - Fixes foreign key constraints and column types
- `verify-product-exists.sql` - Debug script to check if products exist

### Application Code (Already Updated)
- `src/services/ProductService.ts` - Uses meaningful IDs for products
- `src/services/individualProductService.ts` - Uses meaningful IDs for individual products  
- `src/services/rawMaterialService.ts` - Uses meaningful IDs for raw materials
- `src/services/auditService.ts` - Uses meaningful IDs for audit logs
- `src/lib/supabase.ts` - Updated Insert types to allow custom IDs
- `src/pages/Products.tsx` - Fixed product creation flow
- `src/pages/ProductStock.tsx` - Fixed dimension display

## üîß Key Features Implemented

### Meaningful ID Generation
- **Products**: `PRO-YYMMDD-XXX` (e.g., PRO-250916-001)
- **Individual Products**: `IPD-YYMMDD-XXX` (e.g., IPD-250916-001)  
- **Raw Materials**: `RM-YYMMDD-XXX` (e.g., RM-250916-001)
- **Audit Logs**: `QR-YYMMDD-XXX` (e.g., QR-250916-001)

### Fixed Issues
‚úÖ Removed pricing fields (sellingPrice, costPrice, totalCost)
‚úÖ Fixed unit selection (now defaults to 'units' instead of 'pieces')
‚úÖ Removed dimension-related code from ProductStock
‚úÖ Fixed individual product creation flow
‚úÖ Added proper error handling and user feedback
‚úÖ Fixed foreign key constraint issues

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If you still get foreign key errors:
1. Run the `simplified-database-fix.sql` script
2. Check the console for any remaining errors
3. Verify that products are being created with meaningful IDs

### If individual products aren't created:
1. Make sure "Track Individual Stock" is enabled when creating a product
2. Check the browser console for error messages
3. Verify the product was created successfully first

## üìä Expected Behavior

### Creating a Product:
1. Fill out product form
2. Enable "Track Individual Stock" 
3. Set quantity (e.g., 5)
4. Click "Add Product"
5. Should see: "Product created successfully with ID: PRO-250916-XXX"
6. Should see: "Created 5 individual products with IDs: IPD-250916-XXX"

### Product IDs Should Look Like:
- Product: `PRO-250916-001`
- Individual Product: `IPD-250916-001`, `IPD-250916-002`, etc.
- Raw Material: `RM-250916-001`
- Audit Log: `QR-250916-001`

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Test the application** - Create products and verify IDs
2. **Check all pages** - Ensure everything works correctly
3. **Test edge cases** - Try creating products without individual tracking
4. **Verify data persistence** - Check that data saves correctly in Supabase

## üìû Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify the database schema matches the expected structure
3. Ensure all SQL scripts have been run successfully
4. Check that the IDGenerator is working correctly
